Netty:
  Netty is NIO client server framework. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such TCP and UDP socket server.
  Aslo privde HTTP&Websocket, SSL, Google Protobuf, RTSP, Large file Transfer, Zlib/gzip compression, Legacy Text -Binary Protocols supports.
  Transport Services: socket&Datagram, HTTP Tunnel, In-VM Pipe
  Performance:
	Better throughput, lower latency
	Less resource comsumption
	Minimized unnecessary memory copy

Difference NIO and IO
  NIO means the thread will not wait for the resource While it request resource which is using by other thread. the thread will continue to ask for other resource,
  IO means the thread will wait for the requested resource until it released by other thread. 

Difference synchonize and asynchonize:
 synchonize which means must have ack to continue; asynchonize. AJAX is sample of NIO.
BIO (block IO):Sychonize IO
  Synchonize IO, jdk1.4. for example: one server deal with multiple clients. Server will create and destroy connection often and cause resource pressure. In the mean time, BIO will bring in thread pool to release pressure.
NIO(Non-block IO):sychonize NIO
  selector, channel, buffer
  When client intents to build connection with server, client has to register on selector and selector will create a channel which transfer data between c/s by buffer.
AIO:Sychonize NIO
   Notify client when client request has done. 


Step 1: Hello Netty
  1.Build master/slave thread pool
  2.BootStrapServer define
  3.Set channels
  4.Define a class that Initialize handlers.Function as inteceptor.
  5.Start listener.
  6. run as localhost:8088
